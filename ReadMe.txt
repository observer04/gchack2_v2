# IMPORTANT NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION:
# 1. Use encoder_weights=None for multispectral data (NO ImageNet!)
# 2. Load HKH pretrained weights before fine-tuning
# 3. Apply TTA (Test-Time Augmentation) for robust predictions
# 4. Post-process with morphology and CRF
# 5. Output format: {0, 85, 170, 255} for {Background, Glacier, Debris, Lake}

    """Here’s exactly how to use the HKH glacier_mapping repo for pretraining, tune it for your project, and how you can enhance your workflow with GlaViTU.

***

## How to Use glacier_mapping (HKH Pretraining) for Competition

### 1. **Dataset Prep**
- Download the HKH Glacier dataset (~7k tiles, Landsat 7 multispectral, mask files).
- Make sure bands align: pick the best matches for your competition’s 5 bands (typically B1-B5, but can include TIR and SWIR). Ignore bands you won't need.

### 2. **Preprocessing**
- Use the repo’s slicing tools to ensure 512x512 tiles and mask alignment.
- Use their transform scripts to convert the original tiffs and shapefile labels to numpy tensors.
- Normalize using statistics computed from HKH data, NOT ImageNet.

### 3. **Masking and Filtering**
- Use `generate_masks()` and `write_pair_slices()` to get clean numpy arrays of images and masks.
- Filter slices with rich debris/lake content using the provided filtering scripts; don’t oversample background.

### 4. **Model Pretraining**
- Use the glacier_mapping repo’s Unet (with Dropout, boundary-aware loss):
    - Set `encoder_weights=None` for real multispectral learning.
    - Use standard configs, then tune: batch size 16, Focal+Dice+Boundary losses, stratified image-level CV.

- Train for 50–80 epochs on HKH data. Save the best weights as `hkh_pretrained.pt`.
- Make sure your output mask conventions (class order, encoding) match what your competition requires.

### 5. **Transfer Learning / Fine-tuning**
- Initialize your competition model (Unet, Swin-UNet, BA-UNet, etc.) with the HKH-pretrained weights.
- Fine-tune on your competition dataset (25 images) for 80+ epochs.
- Use your competition loss (can add MCC loss at this stage), the same normalization pipeline, and strong augmentations.
- Always validate with image-level stratified folds.

### 6. **Inference and Solution Packaging**
- Your solution.py should load the fine-tuned weights, accept new test band files, apply necessary transforms, and output masks as required (0/85/170/255 per .tif).

## How to Integrate/Enhance with GlaViTU ([GlaViTU-IGARSS2023](https://github.com/konstantin-a-maslov/GlaViTU-IGARSS2023))

### 1. **Why Use GlaViTU**
- GlaViTU is a hybrid CNN-Transformer built directly for glacier mapping, tested on multiple regions.
- It can leverage global context (with transformer branches) plus local spatial precision (with U-Net).
- Generalizes better, can boost MCC and IoU on novel test images.

### 2. **Integration Pathways**
#### **Option A: Use HKH Pretraining for GlaViTU Encoder**
- Train GlaViTU on HKH with the same band alignment.
- Export GlaViTU checkpoints and encoder weights.
- Fine-tune the whole GlaViTU pipeline on your competition data (using your splits and augmentations).
- This ensures the transformer branch learns global glacier features relevant to HKH—and your competition images.

#### **Option B: Ensemble with BA-UNet/U-Net**
- Train your U-Net/BA-UNet on HKH → competition data as above.
- Train GlaViTU in parallel (with or without HKH pretraining).
- On competition test data, perform ensemble inference: average or weighted softmax outputs from both models to predict final masks.
- Ensemble typically boosts MCC on hard/debris/rare classes.

#### **Option C: Distillation**
- Use both GlaViTU and HKH-pretrained U-Net as teachers.
- Distill their outputs to a lighter student model (efficient U-Net or Swin-UNet), constrained to <300MB, for competition submission.

### 3. **Tuning GlaViTU**
- Use the repo’s training scripts (config files allow you to specify input features, region encoding, loss types).
- Start with global training, then region-specific fine-tuning.
- Set up data configs using your HKH and competition bands.
- Use GlaViTU's advanced postprocessing (region encoding, bias optimization) for best generalization.

### 4. **Considerations**
- The biggest MCC jump comes from HKH pretraining—apply it to whatever architecture you use (Unet, GlaViTU, etc.).
- Always check compatibility: class ordering, value ranges, mask format, and input bands.
- For GlaViTU, ensure all competition bands are mapped into the model’s expected features (optical, thermal, dem, etc).

***

## Workflow Summary

**Pretrain on HKH (glacier_mapping)** → Export weights → **Fine-tune on competition data (Unet, BA-UNet, or GlaViTU)** → **Ensemble or distill for final solution.py**.

- Use all boundary-aware and class sampling improvements during both stages.
- For all code, keep clear configs and reproducible seeds.
- Document every parameter and checkpoint for future troubleshooting.

**Bottom Line:**  
- HKH pretraining is plug-and-play: slice, mask, train Unet as repo instructs, then transfer weights to your model (Unet/GlaViTU).
- GlaViTU can enhance the pipeline as either main, ensemble, or distillation teacher—use HKH data for its global pretraining phase for best results.  
- Ensure final solution.py is <300MB and matches competition mask convention.

Apply this as your standard pipeline. If you need more step-by-step integration for the actual code configs or scripts, just ask!

       d. Ensemble prediction (weighted average of softmax)
       e. Post-process (morphology + CRF)
